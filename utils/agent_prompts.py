DATASET_CREATION_PROMPT = """You are roleplaying as a smart home user. Generate a natural language query to control smart home devices based on the provided JSON input.

Follow these rules:

1.  **Language & Script:**
    *   Strictly use the specific language *and* script provided in the input `language` field, which follows the format `Language (Script)`.
    *   Ensure the entire query is consistently in that language and script.
    *   Use natural phrasing and common colloquial terms appropriate for the specified language.

2.  **Task Sequencing:**
    *   Interpret the `execution_type` field for each device ('sequential' or 'concurrent').
    *   For `sequential` tasks, use natural connecting words or phrases within the target language that indicate one action follows another (expressing concepts like "then", "after", "once", "next").
    *   For `concurrent` tasks, use natural connecting words or phrases within the target language that indicate actions happening simultaneously or together (expressing concepts like "and", "while", "at the same time", "along with").
    *   Combine these naturally for inputs containing both types, respecting the specified order and dependencies based on the `execution_type` of each device.

3.  **Device Commands:**
    *   For each device listed in `devices`:
        *   Formulate a user-friendly command integrating the device name (unless vagueness applies, see rule 4), the `mode`, and all parameters from the `args` dictionary (if provided). Use common household terms for devices when names *are* used.
        *   Use common action verbs ("turn on", "set", "start", "chalao", "koro", etc.) relevant to the language and action.

4.  **Vagueness:**
    *   If the input `vagueness` field is `true`:
        *   **Reduce Specificity:** Aim for a more natural, less explicit command. This can be done in two ways:
            *   **Omit Device Name:** If the requested action (`mode` and `args`) strongly implies the device type (e.g., "change channel", "set temperature", "play music"), omit the specific device name (like "TV", "AC", "Speaker").
            *   **Use Generic Terms:** If omitting the name is awkward or ambiguous, use a generic category instead of the specific device name (e.g., "cooling" instead of "AC", "laundry" instead of "Washing Machine", "entertainment" instead of "TV").
        *   Apply the most natural form of vagueness based on the command and language context.
    *   If `vagueness` is `false`, always use the specific device names from the input.

5.  **Query Style:**
    *   Structure the query logically and keep it concise yet natural.
    *   Aim for a conversational tone typical of a user interacting with a smart home system.

6.  **Output Format:**
    *   Provide **ONLY** the JSON output in the specified format: `{{"generated_query": "<query>"}}`
    *   Do not include any explanations, greetings, or text outside the JSON structure.

Input Format: {{"language": "<language (script)>","task_type": "<Sequential|Concurrent|Mixed>","device_count": <count>,"devices": [{{"device": "<device_name>","mode": "<mode>","args": <args_dict_or_null>,"execution_type": "<sequential|concurrent>"}}],"vagueness": <boolean>}}
